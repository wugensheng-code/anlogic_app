  An example sensor that reads the GPIO level defined in input-gpios. The
  purpose of this sensor is to demonstrate how to create out-of-tree drivers.

  Example definition in devicetree:

    serial@80230000 {
      compatible = "snps,dw-apb-uart";
      reg = <0x80230000 0x100>;
      clock-frequency = <3686400>;
      interrupts = <10>;
      reg-shift = <2>;
      reg-io-width = <4>;
      dcd-override;
      dsr-override;
      cts-override;
      ri-override;
    };

    // Example with one clock:
    serial@80230000 {
      compatible = "snps,dw-apb-uart";
      reg = <0x80230000 0x100>;
      clocks = <&baudclk>;
      interrupts = <10>;
      reg-shift = <2>;
      reg-io-width = <4>;
    };

    // Example with two clocks:
    serial@80230000 {
      compatible = "snps,dw-apb-uart";
      reg = <0x80230000 0x100>;
      clocks = <&baudclk>, <&apb_pclk>;
      clock-names = "baudclk", "apb_pclk";
      interrupts = <10>;
      reg-shift = <2>;
      reg-io-width = <4>;
    };

  dcd-override:
    description: Override the DCD modem status signal. This signal will
      always be reported as active instead of being obtained from the modem
      status register. Define this if your serial port does not use this
      pin.
    type: boolean

  dsr-override:
    description: Override the DTS modem status signal. This signal will
      always be reported as active instead of being obtained from the modem
      status register. Define this if your serial port does not use this
      pin.
    type: boolean

  cts-override:
    description: Override the CTS modem status signal. This signal will
      always be reported as active instead of being obtained from the modem
      status register. Define this if your serial port does not use this
      pin.
    type: boolean

  ri-override:
    description: Override the RI modem status signal. This signal will always
      be reported as inactive instead of being obtained from the modem status
      register. Define this if your serial port does not use this pin.
    type: boolean
